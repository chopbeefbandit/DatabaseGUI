# CSE3330 Project 1

This is a project I created for my databases class. I built a GUI using the Swing framework and attached it to the java program that is connected to a car rental database system I designed in SQL. The Connector.java file establishes a connection to the server, and loads relevant data into the GUI for user interaction. The user is offered several options to view and edit the data, including booking new reservations, checking previous reservations, and filtering available vehicles by category for booking. The database was written in MySQL Workbench.
